# Changes Made to Fix Profile and Firebase Issues

## 1. Firebase Configuration Changes
- Updated `firebase/config.js` to properly initialize two separate Firebase app instances:
  - User app (for auth, user profiles, orders)
  - Admin app (for product data only)
- Exposed proper Firestore instances (`db` for user data, `adminDb` for admin data)

## 2. Created Service Modules
- Created `services/users.js` to handle user data operations with the user Firebase project
- Created `services/orders.js` to handle order operations with the user Firebase project
- Updated `services/products.js` to use the admin Firebase project

## 3. Updated Component Files
- Modified `Profile.jsx` to use the user service instead of direct Firestore calls
- Updated `AuthContext.jsx` to use the user service for user data
- Updated `Checkout.jsx` to use the orders service
- Updated imports and fixed error handling in all affected components

## 4. Security Rules
- Created `firestore.rules` with proper security rules for the user Firebase project
- Created `FIREBASE_RULES_DEPLOYMENT.md` with instructions for deploying the rules

## 5. Utility Functions
- Added `utils/keys.js` for generating React keys

## Actions Needed:
1. **Deploy the security rules**: Follow the instructions in `FIREBASE_RULES_DEPLOYMENT.md` to deploy the security rules to your user Firebase project.
2. **Test user operations**: Verify that user sign-up, login, profile management, and order creation work correctly.
3. **Verify product loading**: Ensure products still load correctly from the admin project.

## Future Improvements:
1. Add error boundaries for better error handling
2. Implement proper loading states
3. Add unit tests for the service functions
4. Consider TypeScript for better type safety
5. Optimize Firestore queries for better performance
